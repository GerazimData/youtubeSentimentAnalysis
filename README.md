# Welcome to youtubeSentimentAnalysis

On this project I have used a public Youtube Dataset from kaggle on some channels go gain insight by:
1. Perfoming a sentiment analysis, to see how users feel about certain vidoes and to visualize what positive and negative words are used the most by users.
2. Performing a category analysis to see what catogory of vidoes are liked the most by users and create recommendations based on that.

All the project is done in Python.
